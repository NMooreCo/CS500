# CSC500 Principles of Programming

This course introduces students to the skills needed to plan and create their own programming applications, user interface design skills, object-oriented concepts, and planning tools such as pseudocode and flowcharts. Students also learn to create and manipulate variables, constants, strings, sequential access files, classes, dictionaries, lists, and arrays. Additionally, students will learn how to create programs using recursion, how to plot and visualize data, and how to develop object-oriented programs using inheritance. This course teaches programming concepts using a hands-on approach where students are able to gain mastery of these skills by performing practical exercises in each module and reviewing videos for visual instruction. After the successful completion of this course, students will be able to develop applications that are used in the workplace.
