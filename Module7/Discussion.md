# Module 7: Discussion Forum

Working with Python, you could either use a predefined function/method or write a user-defined function/method. What are three criteria that you would use to determine whether to use predefined or user-defined functions/methods? Discuss your rationale in your post. Lastly, provide an example of your method declaration and return type. Actively participate in this discussion by providing constructive feedback and/or justifications on the criteria, rationales, and examples posted by your peers.
